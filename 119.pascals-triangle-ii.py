#
# Given a non-negative index k where k ≤ 33, return the k^th index row of the
# Pascal's triangle.
# 
# Note that the row index starts from 0.
# 
# 
# In Pascal's triangle, each number is the sum of the two numbers directly
# above it.
# 
# Example:
# 
# 
# Input: 3
# Output: [1,3,3,1]
# 
# 
# Follow up:
# 
# Could you optimize your algorithm to use only O(k) extra space?

class Solution:
    def getRow(self, rowIndex: int) -> List[int]:
        numRows = rowIndex + 1
        pascal = [[1]*(i+1) for i in range(numRows)]
        for i in range(numRows):
            for j in range(1,i):
                pascal[i][j] = pascal[i-1][j-1] + pascal[i-1][j]
        return pascal[-1]
