//Suppose you have a long flowerbed in which some of the plots are planted and s
//ome are not. However, flowers cannot be planted in adjacent plots - they would c
//ompete for water and both would die. 
//
// Given a flowerbed (represented as an array containing 0 and 1, where 0 means 
//empty and 1 means not empty), and a number n, return if n new flowers can be pla
//nted in it without violating the no-adjacent-flowers rule. 
//
// Example 1: 
// 
//Input: flowerbed = [1,0,0,0,1], n = 1
//Output: True
// 
// 
//
// Example 2: 
// 
//Input: flowerbed = [1,0,0,0,1], n = 2
//Output: False
// 
// 
//
// Note: 
// 
// The input array won't violate no-adjacent-flowers rule. 
// The input array size is in the range of [1, 20000]. 
// n is a non-negative integer which won't exceed the input array size.
